# Modular Inverse
For two numbers _a_ and _m_, modular inverse of *a* (mod *m*) exists iff _a_ and _m_ are **coprimes**. This can be proved using **Bezout's Identity**(Reverse Euclidean Algorithm) to compute the *gcd* of two numbers. if the gcd of two numbers _a_ and _m_ is d, then Bezout's identity can be written as **a*x + m*y = d** where _x_ and _y_ are integers and can be computed by working Euclidean algorithm to compute gcd, backwards.
